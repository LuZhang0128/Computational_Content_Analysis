Y,5,Loved it! Can’t wait until I can buy it and watch it as much as I want
Y,5,"wowwww really good movie, you see you can make movies that honor fans and the characters and also make changes, all you had to do its to write a good movie, really had a blast seen it"
Y,4,Started slow but got better!
Y,3,Spiderman: Into the Spiderverse did it better but still entertaining. Would have been better if no so long.
Y,5,whole movie was great
Y,2,"the only cool thing is Dr Strange thing. didn't like the plot, basically all for worse. and too much comics type of humor"
Y,4,"I really enjoyed the movie. I didn't know the plot, so it was cool to bring back past Spiderman actors and villains. I will watch it again, once released."
Y,2,I thought it was slow and didnt have the usual Spider-Man movie humor.
Y,2,"Have liked all the other Spiderman movies. This last one just seemed a bit too far ""out there"" Couldn't get into the three Spidermen. Lies all the others - not this one"
Y,5,action packed and full of surprises!!!
Y,5,My girlfriend said she’d throat spider-man.
Y,3,Nothing spectacular or unexpected
Y,1,"Worst spiderman movie ever, sorry i waited so long to see it"
Y,2,It was drawn out. It didn't seem put together well. Compared to the computerized effects the human element seemed almost boring.
Y,4,"Good movie, but I wish people would control their ridiculously loud kids. I don't pay to see a movie to hear your kid running back and forth behind me. Nobody wants to listen to your kids and that you don't know how to control their noise levels."
Y,4,"Very good movie, but the ending was depressing"
Y,5,I like the story of it and the fighting scene of it.
Y,4,Touching continuation of SM. Finally gave him the character development and motivation they should have given him 4yrs ago
Y,3,Liked it! Good surprises
Y,3,"It was good, but loooooong!"
Y,5,Amazing! I enjoyed it throughout the whole movie. Lived up to all hype/expectations i had and more.
Y,1,"Soooooo boring and underwhelming! I didn't go in expecting anything fabulous but man, the writing was trite and incredibly predictable. We left half way through because we had better things to do."
Y,4,oh my gosh. I saw this movie in December and my god. It's become my favourite movie of all time. this movie makes me excited to see what's to come next for Spider-Man. It was very emotional I have to say the movie was. Like I can't describe how amazing the movie was. :)
Y,5,It was the best movie Ive ever watched! Hands down!!!!!!!!!
Y,5,kept me in the edge of my seat
Y,1,well i tried to cancel and it wouldn’t let me! So not real happy!
Y,1,The movie concession stand was totally substandard and the service was extremely poor!!! I would not recommend this theater for anything!!!
Y,5,Best Spiderman movie! Loved it and would see it again!!
Y,4,"Action packed, Tom Holland did great..."
Y,1,this movie was definitely not
Y,3,"Good plot, with surprise guest stars, yet the movie was probably 30 minutes too long. The battle scenes were much too long."
Y,5,Best spider mine movie
Y,3,"Made well, but the plot was boring"
Y,2,I thought the movie dragged the beginning and the end were the best part of the movie
Y,5,Was fantastic seeing all Spidermen and villains together in one movie. Was like a step right out of the comic books.
Y,5,Was fast paced and interesting.
Y,5,"The storyline is awesome, the acting superb, and the special effects mind blowing.,Definitely one of the best movies of the year! Marvel!!"
Y,4,Loved the nostalgia.
Y,2,"This felt like the ""extra"" episode in a show where they basically just recut old stuff and didn't bother with any sort of plot. Then the whole Dr. Strange part made it feel like it was just a dream or something. None of it was real, so I never got invested in the movie. It also felt like half of the lines in the movie were awkwardly improvised."
Y,3,Movie was alright. Wasnt blown away how everyone was hyping it up. Decent at best.
Y,4,Great movie although slightly long.
Y,2,overrated....entertaining enough but could have solved problem and saved many lives at around 40 minute mark....people give it 5 stars simply bc its marvel...expect better
Y,5,"Excelsior! A true masterpiece; absolutely mind-blowing and nuts. With all that cheering in theaters, I would say this is the best Spiderman movie of all time. I would say more, but the scene with all the 3 spidermen says it all."
Y,1,"It was boring and too cartoonish, but what did I expect? I walked out. I wish I could get my money back."
Y,3,"It is not perfect like the people say, but it is a nice one. Very nostalgic (Fan Service), and weird CGI."
Y,5,Best and possibly better than I expected.
Y,1,"Pure Fan-Service. I like Marvel and i really love Spiderman but this movie is such a disappointment. Really, its bad. The actor's are really great, but the story, vfx and the direction is not soo good. Hope Marvel do better next time, the last few movies were really terrible."
Y,4,Great special effects.
Y,1,"Had so much potential, but it was an awful and disappointing experience. To quote one article ""the multiverse could have made Garfield and Maguire tangible elements of the MCU, and the same goes for their cavalcade of respective villains, but instead they are little more than forced cameos with awful dialogue and half-baked action sequences that feel paintfully out of place."""
Y,3,too long .best part was the Venom cameo at the end
N,0,Very well done. Cinematic’s were awesome!!!!
N,0,I liked seeing Doctor Octopus as a good guy.
N,0,Amazing movie. What made it better was adding Tobey Maguir and Andrew Garfield
N,0,Okay someone done stepped the game up a bit
N,0,"AWESOME ! GR8! ANAZING !
AWESOME ! GR8! ANAZING !
AWESOME ! GR8! ANAZING !
"
N,0,Omg. If you've seen all the Spidy movies in the past. This is a must!
N,0,Likes seeing all the characters together and the different Peter Parkers.
N,0,very good movie from start to finish.
N,0,Movie a little too long
N,0,"A good intention, and perhaps it was the film to be made, but they needed more time to make a good script. The result was mediocre: everything related to Dr. Strange is wrong, the resolutions of the stories are easy. It was a wasted opportunity to make millions of dollars fast and satisfy undemanding audiences. After the two previous installments of this Spiderman, after Endgame, after Civil War, Marvel could do something much better."
N,0,"Silly motivation coupled with 101 level dialogue and sad, tired retread Spidermen make it less than rewarding. Dr. Strange would never have cast that spell, and if he had - would not have done it so incompetently. If this series continues, and I am not sure it should, we are gonna miss Marisa Tomei."
N,0,No story line. Gave me no emotional attachment
N,0,Acting was good. Cinematography was good. Plot was somewhat predictable and juvenile.
N,0,I didn’t get to watch it cause of the fire alarm u think I can get my money back pls
N,0,"Great to see the Spiderverse represented. I felt, for better or worse, that I was watching a Marvel/Sony crossover made by Marvel. Lived up but did not exceed my expectations, which is praise with the hype that has been made. Sad in spots, some humor, and plenty for fans to like."
N,0,Just ok. Storyline was kinda slow
N,0,Was exciting! Liked special effects! Good positive message! At times a bit predictable.
N,0,Worst movie ive ever watched. Its just so frustrating watching spider man make the worst choices. This situation wouldve never happend in the comics. Its a stupid excuse to bring all the spidermen together.
N,0,best acting in a superhero film.
N,0,This movie was amazing! They seriously have something with this story.
