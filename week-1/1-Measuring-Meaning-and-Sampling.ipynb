    "I want to conduct this study to understand how the online setting creates new opportunities and challenges for social movements. Meanwhile, as traditional studies are in person, the posters and propaganda are challenging to analyze on a large scale. Online social movements provide us with a great opportunity to learn more about how content and sentiment change over time. Some other online social sites to consider are Facebook and Reddit. Reddit is easy to scrape using its API when both Twitter and Facebook fail. One limitation is that users may also have offline interactions hidden from the online network but can significantly impact the individual or collective actions. Moreover, private accounts' tweets are not included in my dataset. I can scale up my sample by simply identifying more hashtags. The data parsing code and analysis procedure can easily be reproduced."
